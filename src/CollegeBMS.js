Most commonly, first-year students choose between Warren Towers and West Campus. They're best for first-years for the social aspect and the in-building dining hall. Second-years usually move on to brownstones or the other traditional-style dorms like Hojo or Myles Standish. Many upperclassmen stay in apartment style dorms or StuVi for the kitchen."/>
